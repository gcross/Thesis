@ARTICLE{Deutsch08071985,
  author = {Deutsch, D.},
  title = {Quantum Theory, the Church-Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum
	Computer},
  journal = {Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. A. Mathematical and Physical
	Sciences},
  year = {1985},
  volume = {400},
  pages = {97-117},
  number = {1818},
  abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is
	an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented
	explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical
	system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing
	machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal
	Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete,
	do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class
	of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of
	the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum
	theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the
	principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer
	could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties
	not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the
	computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum
	parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be
	performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
	restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties
	places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory
	other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the
	quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored.
	Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition
	of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does
	classical complexity theory.},
