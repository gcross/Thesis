  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group discovered by White is investigated.
	In the case where renormalization eventually converges to a fixed
	point we show that quantum states in the thermodynamic limit with
	periodic boundary conditions can be simply represented by a "matrix
	product state" with a natural description of Block states of elementary
	excitations. We then observe that these states can be rederived through
	a simple variational ansatz making to reference to a renormalization
	construction. The method is tested on the spin-1 Heisenberg model.

  abstract = {We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit a local description
	on a regular D -dimensional lattice. Specifically, we assume that
	the stabilizer group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes)
	can be generated by local Pauli operators such that the support of
	any generator is bounded by a hypercube of size O (1). Our first
	result concerns the optimal scaling of the distance d with the linear
	size of the lattice L . We prove an upper bound d = O ( L D -1 )
	which is tight for D =1, 2. This bound applies to both subspace and
	subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability
	of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory.
	Any stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally
	transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate
	the stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground state of this Hamiltonian
	corresponds to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for
	D =1, 2, different logical states can be mapped into each other by
	a sequence of single-qubit Pauli errors such that the energy of all
	intermediate states is upper bounded by a constant independent of
	the lattice size L . The same result holds if there are unused logical
	qubits that are treated as 'gauge qubits'. It demonstrates that a
	self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes
	in dimensions D =1, 2. This result is in sharp contrast with the
	existence of a classical self-correcting memory in the form of a
	two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. Our results leave open the possibility
	for a self-correcting quantum memory based on 2D subsystem codes
	or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.},

  abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is
	an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented
	explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical
	system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing
	machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal
	Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete,
	do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class
	of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of
	the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum
	theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the
	principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer
	could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties
	not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the
	computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum
	parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be
	performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
	restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties
	places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory
	other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the
	quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored.
	Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition
	of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does
	classical complexity theory.},

  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach is arguably
	the most successful method to numerically find ground states of quantum
	spin chains. It amounts to iteratively locally optimizing matrix-product
	states, aiming at better and better approximating the true ground
	state. To date, both a proof of convergence to the globally best
	approximation and an assessment of its complexity are lacking. Here
	we establish a result on the computational complexity of an approximation
	with matrix-product states: The surprising result is that when one
	globally optimizes over several sites of local Hamiltonians, avoiding
	local optima, one encounters in the worst case a computationally
	difficult NP-hard problem (hard even in approximation). The proof
	exploits a novel way of relating it to binary quadratic programming.
	We discuss intriguing ramifications on the difficulty of describing
	quantum many-body systems.},

	new mechanism based on the concept of resolution-wise and resolution-driven
	image mappings is developed to create rich families of legitimate
	similarity images so as to reduce the overall WFA size, a property
	that is critically related the performance of WFA-based compression

  abstract = {Entanglement between three or more parties exhibits a realm of properties
	unknown to two-party states. Bipartite states are easily classified
	using the Schmidt decomposition. The Schmidt coefficients of a bipartite
	pure state encompass all the non-local properties of the state and
	can be "seen" by looking at one party's density matrix only. Pure
	states of three and more parties however lack such a simple form.
	They have more invariants under local unitary transformations than
	any one party can "see" on their sub-system. These "hidden non-localities"
	will allow us to exhibit a class of multipartite states that cannot
	be distinguished from each other by any party. Generalizing a result
	of BPRST and using a recent result by Nielsen we will show that these
	states cannot be transformed into each other by local actions and
	classical communication. Furthermore we will use an orthogonal subset
	of such states to hint at applications to cryptography and illustrate
	an extension to quantum secret sharing (using recently suggested
	((n,k))-threshold schemes).},

	quickly become the method of choice for numerical studies of such

	The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional

	and time-dependent phenomena is also discussed. This review additionally
	considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its

	critical and topological properties as well as resonating valence
	bond states. We prove, in particular, that coherent versions of thermal
	states of any local 2D classical spin model correspond to such PEPS,
	which are in turn ground states of local 2D quantum Hamiltonians.
	This correspondence maps thermal onto quantum fluctuations, and it
	allows us to analytically construct critical quantum models exhibiting
	a strict area law scaling of the entanglement entropy in the face
	of power law decaying correlations. Moreover, it enables us to show
	that there exist PEPS within the same class as the cluster state,
	which can serve as computational resources for the solution of NP-hard
	problems.},
