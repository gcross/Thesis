  title = {A no-go theorem for a two-dimensional self-correcting quantum memory
	based on stabilizer codes},
  journal = {New Journal of Physics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {043029},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit a local description
	on a regular D -dimensional lattice. Specifically, we assume that
	the stabilizer group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes)
	can be generated by local Pauli operators such that the support of
	any generator is bounded by a hypercube of size O (1). Our first
	result concerns the optimal scaling of the distance d with the linear
	size of the lattice L . We prove an upper bound d = O ( L D -1 )
	which is tight for D =1, 2. This bound applies to both subspace and
	subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability
	of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory.
	Any stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally
	transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate
	the stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground state of this Hamiltonian
	corresponds to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for
	D =1, 2, different logical states can be mapped into each other by
	a sequence of single-qubit Pauli errors such that the energy of all
	intermediate states is upper bounded by a constant independent of
	the lattice size L . The same result holds if there are unused logical
	qubits that are treated as 'gauge qubits'. It demonstrates that a
	self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes
	in dimensions D =1, 2. This result is in sharp contrast with the
	existence of a classical self-correcting memory in the form of a
	two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. Our results leave open the possibility
	for a self-correcting quantum memory based on 2D subsystem codes
	or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.},

  abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church-Turing hypothesis there is
	an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented
	explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical
	system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing
	machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal
	Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete,
	do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class
	of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of
	the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum
	theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the
	principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer
	could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties
	not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the
	computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum
	parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be
	performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
	restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties
	places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory
	other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the
	quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored.
	Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition
	of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does
	classical complexity theory.},
