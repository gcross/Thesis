  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group discovered by White is investigated.
	In the case where renormalization eventually converges to a fixed
	point we show that quantum states in the thermodynamic limit with
	periodic boundary conditions can be simply represented by a "matrix
	product state" with a natural description of Block states of elementary
	excitations. We then observe that these states can be rederived through
	a simple variational ansatz making to reference to a renormalization
	construction. The method is tested on the spin-1 Heisenberg model.

	provides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues
	in quantum computation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and
	constructing fault tolerant quantum computers. In particular, by
	translating the main open questions in the area of quantum algorithms
	to the language of spectral gaps of sparse matrices, the result makes
	these questions accessible to a wider scientific audience, acquainted

  abstract = {We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit a local description
	on a regular D -dimensional lattice. Specifically, we assume that
	the stabilizer group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes)
	can be generated by local Pauli operators such that the support of
	any generator is bounded by a hypercube of size O (1). Our first
	result concerns the optimal scaling of the distance d with the linear
	size of the lattice L . We prove an upper bound d = O ( L D -1 )
	which is tight for D =1, 2. This bound applies to both subspace and
	subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability
	of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory.
	Any stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally
	transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate
	the stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground state of this Hamiltonian
	corresponds to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for
	D =1, 2, different logical states can be mapped into each other by
	a sequence of single-qubit Pauli errors such that the energy of all
	intermediate states is upper bounded by a constant independent of
	the lattice size L . The same result holds if there are unused logical
	qubits that are treated as 'gauge qubits'. It demonstrates that a
	self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes
	in dimensions D =1, 2. This result is in sharp contrast with the
	existence of a classical self-correcting memory in the form of a
	two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. Our results leave open the possibility
	for a self-correcting quantum memory based on 2D subsystem codes
	or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.},

	an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented
	explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical
	system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing
	machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal
	Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete,
	do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class
	of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of
	the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum
	theory and the `universal quantum computer' are compatible with the
	principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer
	could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties
	not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the
	computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum
	parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be
	performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
	restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties
	places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory
	other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the
	quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored.
	Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition
	of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does
	classical complexity theory.},

  abstract = {Using exact diagonalizations, Green's function Monte Carlo simulations
	and high-order perturbation theory, we study the low-energy properties
	of the two-dimensional spin-1/2 compass model on the square lattice
	defined by the Hamiltonian $H = - \sum_{\bm{r}} (J_x \sigma_{\bm{r}}^x
	\sigma_{\bm{r} + \bm{e}_x}^x + J_z \sigma_{\bm{r}}^z \sigma_{\bm{r}
	+ \bm{e}_z}^z)$. When $J_x\ne J_z$, we show that, on clusters of
	dimension $L\times L$, the low-energy spectrum consists of $2^L$
	states which collapse onto each other exponentially fast with $L$,
	a conclusion that remains true arbitrarily close to $J_x=J_z$. At
	that point, we show that an even larger number of states collapse
	exponentially fast with $L$ onto the ground state, and we present
	numerical evidence that this number is precisely $2\times 2^L$. We
	also extend the symmetry analysis of the model to arbitrary spins
	and show that the two-fold degeneracy of all eigenstates remains
	true for arbitrary half-integer spins but does not apply to integer
	spins, in which cases eigenstates are generically non degenerate,
	a result confirmed by exact diagonalizations in the spin-1 case.
	Implications for Mott insulators and Josephson junction arrays are
	briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach is arguably
	the most successful method to numerically find ground states of quantum
	spin chains. It amounts to iteratively locally optimizing matrix-product
	states, aiming at better and better approximating the true ground
	state. To date, both a proof of convergence to the globally best
	approximation and an assessment of its complexity are lacking. Here
	we establish a result on the computational complexity of an approximation
	with matrix-product states: The surprising result is that when one
	globally optimizes over several sites of local Hamiltonians, avoiding
	local optima, one encounters in the worst case a computationally
	difficult NP-hard problem (hard even in approximation). The proof
	exploits a novel way of relating it to binary quadratic programming.
	We discuss intriguing ramifications on the difficulty of describing
	quantum many-body systems.},

	problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum
	state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates
	between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct,
	and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying
	assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final
	ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required
	depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states
	of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this
	gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability
	problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show
	that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

	an algorithm for automatic image encoding using WFA as a basis for
	a practical image data compression method. In this paper we introduce
	k-tape weighted finite automata. We are mainly interested in the
	case of 2 tapes called weighted finite transducers (WFT). We show
	that the most commonly used image transformations can be defined
	by WFTs. We also show that WFT transformations are closed under union
	and composition and that the family of WFA images is closed under
	WFT transformations. },

	to generate functions on [0, 1] x [0, 1] interpreted as gray-tone
	images. Weighted finite transducers (WFT) are finite state devices
	that serve as a powerful tool for describing and implementing a large
	variety of image transformations and more generally linear operators
	on real functions. Here we show new results on WFT and demonstra.te
	that WFT are indeed an excellent tool for image manipulation and
	more generally for function transfbnnation. We note that every WFA
	transformation is a linear operator and show that most of the interesting
	linear operators on real functions (on [0, 1]^2) can be easily implemented
	by WFT. We give a number of examples that include affine transformations,
	a low-pass filter, wavelet transform, (partial) derivatives, simple
	and multiple integrals. Since the family of WFA-functions is constructively
	closed under WFT, each of our examples is actually a proof of a theorem
	stating that for each WFA A there effectively exists another WFA
	B that computes the integral (or other transformations) of the function
	defined by A. },

	new mechanism based on the concept of resolution-wise and resolution-driven

  abstract = {Entanglement between three or more parties exhibits a realm of properties
	unknown to two-party states. Bipartite states are easily classified
	using the Schmidt decomposition. The Schmidt coefficients of a bipartite
	pure state encompass all the non-local properties of the state and
	can be "seen" by looking at one party's density matrix only. Pure
	states of three and more parties however lack such a simple form.
	They have more invariants under local unitary transformations than
	any one party can "see" on their sub-system. These "hidden non-localities"
	will allow us to exhibit a class of multipartite states that cannot
	be distinguished from each other by any party. Generalizing a result
	of BPRST and using a recent result by Nielsen we will show that these
	states cannot be transformed into each other by local actions and
	classical communication. Furthermore we will use an orthogonal subset
	of such states to hint at applications to cryptography and illustrate
	an extension to quantum secret sharing (using recently suggested
	((n,k))-threshold schemes).},

  title = {Fixed-gap adiabatic quantum computation},
  year = {2010},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {Quantum computation has revolutionary potential for speeding algorithms
	and for simulating quantum systems such as molecules. We report here
	a quantum computer design that performs universal quantum computation
	within a single non-degenerate ground state protected from decohering
	noise by an energy gap that we argue is system-size-independent.
	Closely analogous to a traditional electric circuit, it substantially
	changes the requirements for quantum computer construction, easing
	measurement, timing, and heating problems. Using the standard adiabatic
	condition, we present evidence that this design permits "quantum
	concurrent processing" distributing a quantum computation among extra
	qubits to perform a quantum algorithm of N gates in an amount of
	time that scales with the square root of N. One consequence of our
	work is a fixed gap version of adiabatic quantum computation, which
	several arguments hinted could be impossible.},

	assuming the reader has an existing background in differential geometry.
	We concentrate on methods that achieve this by minimizing a cost
	function over the space of orthogonal matrices. We introduce the
	idea of the manifold and Lie group SO Ã°nÃ of special orthogonal
	matrices that we wish to search over, and explain how this is related
	to the Lie algebra so Ã°nÃ of skew-symmetric matrices. We describe
	how familiar optimization methods such as steepest descent and conjugate
	gradients can be transformed into this Lie group setting, and how
	the Newton update step has an alternative Fourier version in SO Ã°nÃ.
	Finally, we introduce the concept of a toral subgroup generated by
	a particular element of the Lie group or Lie algebra, and explore
	how this commutative subgroup might be used to simplify searches
	on our constraint surface. No proofs are presented in this article.

  abstract = {Image coding using quadtrees is useful in many applications and is
	well known in computer vision and graphics. We draw a parallel between
	quadtrees and rational languages that are recognizable by finite
	state automata (FSA), also known as automata. The FSA are shown to
	be an interesting alternative to the corresponding quadtrees. Binary
	im- age (O= black, 1 = white) coding using a FSA follows these two
	steps: (1) automaton construction based on the image quadtree, (2)
	automaton minimization. The display of the coded image is simply
	obtained by step- ping through the automaton. We demonstrate how
	simple image oper- ations can be efficiently implemented directly
	with FSA. Examples are also presented to illustrate the relationship
	between the FSA complexity and the coded images. Finally, the generalization
	of this approach to gray-level images, color images, and volume data
	is discussed. We be- lieve that this automaton coding approach will
	be useful in developing efficient image and data compression algorithms.

  abstract = {We determine the computational power of preparing Projected Entangled
	Pair States (PEPS), as well as the complexity of classically simulating
	them, and generally the complexity of contracting tensor networks.
	While creating PEPS allows to solve PP problems, the latter two tasks
	are both proven to be #P-complete. We further show how PEPS can be
	used to approximate ground states of gapped Hamiltonians, and that
	creating them is easier than creating arbitrary PEPS. The main tool
	for our proofs is a duality between PEPS and postselection which
	allows to use existing results from quantum compexity.},

	This correspondence maps thermal onto quantum fluctuations, and it
	allows us to analytically construct critical quantum models exhibiting
	a strict area law scaling of the entanglement entropy in the face
	of power law decaying correlations. Moreover, it enables us to show

  abstract = {We develop a correction to the density matrix used in density matrix
	renormalization group calculations to take into account the incompleteness
	of the environment block. The correction allows successful calculations
	using only a single site in the center of the system, rather than
	the standard two sites, improving typical computation times by a
	factor of two to four. In addition, in many cases where ordinary
	DMRG can get stuck in metastable configurations, the correction eliminates
	the sticking. We test the new method on the Heisenberg S=1 chain.},
