\chapter{Introduction}

When physicists discovered the laws of quantum mechanics, they were both excited and disappointed.  On the one hand, this new theory did a fantastic job of modeling all of the bizarre microscopic phenomena that they had been encountering in ther labs.  But on the other hand, the theory was fundamentally \emph{nondeterministic}, postulating that reality was generally not in a single observable state but rather existed in many states at once; upon measurement one is selected at random and the rest discarded.
